## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## Java AWT Basics
Java AWT `(Abstract Window Toolkit)` is an API used to create Graphical User Interface (GUI) or Windows-based Java programs and Java AWT components are platform-dependent, which means they are shown in accordance with the operating system’s view. AWT is `heavyweight`, which means that its components consume resources from the underlying operating system (OS). The java.awt package contains AWT API classes such as TextField, Label, TextArea, RadioButton, CheckBox, Choice, List, and so on.
